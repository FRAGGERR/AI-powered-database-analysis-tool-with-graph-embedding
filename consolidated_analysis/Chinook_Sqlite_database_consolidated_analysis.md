## ‚ö° Performance Analysis

### Query Patterns
- Retrieving albums by artist.
- Retrieving tracks by album.
- Retrieving customer order history.
- Retrieving invoices by customer.
- Searching for tracks by genre or media type.
- Generating reports on sales by artist, album, or genre.

### Identified Bottlenecks
- Lack of indexes on frequently joined columns could lead to slow query performance.
- Large table scans without proper indexing could be a bottleneck for certain queries.

### Optimization Opportunities
- Add indexes to foreign key columns (e.g., Track.AlbumId, Track.GenreId, Track.MediaTypeId, Invoice.CustomerId, InvoiceLine.InvoiceId, InvoiceLine.TrackId).
- Add composite indexes for common query patterns (e.g., (ArtistId, AlbumId) on Album table).
- Consider database query optimization techniques (e.g., query rewriting, using appropriate join types).
