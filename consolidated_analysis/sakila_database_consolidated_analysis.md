## üé™ Core Entities & Relationships

### Primary Entities
**Film** (film)
  - Purpose: Stores information about each film in the inventory.
  - Data Volume: Medium

**Customer** (customer)
  - Purpose: Stores customer details, including contact information and rental history.
  - Data Volume: Medium

**Staff** (staff)
  - Purpose: Manages staff accounts and their associated information.
  - Data Volume: Very Low

**Inventory** (inventory)
  - Purpose: Tracks the availability of films at each store location.
  - Data Volume: High


### Key Relationships
**Film ‚Üî Actor** (many-to-many)
  - Meaning: A film can have multiple actors, and an actor can be in multiple films.

**Film ‚Üî Category** (many-to-many)
  - Meaning: A film can belong to multiple categories, and a category can contain multiple films.

**Rental ‚Üî Customer** (many-to-one)
  - Meaning: A customer can have multiple rentals, but a rental belongs to only one customer.

**Rental ‚Üî Inventory** (many-to-one)
  - Meaning: A rental involves one inventory item.

**Payment ‚Üî Rental** (many-to-one)
  - Meaning: A payment is associated with a rental (can be NULL if payment is made separately).

## üìä Data Quality Assessment

### Integrity Analysis
- **Referential Integrity:** Well-maintained with foreign key constraints (mostly).  `film_text` table seems detached.
- **Data Consistency:** High due to normalization and constraints.
- **Completeness Score:** 90/100

### Accuracy Indicators
- Proper data types
- Constraint enforcement
- Indexes on foreign keys

---

## ‚ö° Performance Analysis

### Query Patterns
- Retrieving film details by title or category.
- Searching for customers by name or email.
- Generating reports on rental history and revenue.
- Checking film availability.
- Processing payments.

### Identified Bottlenecks
- Potential for slow queries on large tables without appropriate indexes (especially `film`, `customer`, `rental`, `payment`, `inventory`).
- Complex joins involving multiple tables might be slow without proper indexing.

### Optimization Opportunities
- Add composite indexes to improve join performance (e.g., `rental` table: (customer_id, inventory_id, rental_date)).
- Add indexes on frequently queried columns (e.g., `film.title`, `customer.last_name`, `customer.email`).
- Consider database caching mechanisms.
- Analyze query execution plans to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

## üéØ Use Case Analysis

### Primary Use Cases
**Film Rental**
  - Description: Customers rent films, and the system tracks rentals, returns, and payments.
  - Business Value: Core business functionality; generates revenue.

**Inventory Management**
  - Description: Tracking film availability and managing inventory levels.
  - Business Value: Ensures efficient film management and prevents stockouts.

**Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**
  - Description: Managing customer accounts, tracking rental history, and providing customer support.
  - Business Value: Improves customer satisfaction and loyalty.


### Analytics Opportunities
- Popular film analysis (most rented films).
- Customer segmentation (frequent renters vs. infrequent renters).
- Revenue analysis (total revenue, revenue per film, revenue per customer).
- Inventory optimization (identifying films that need to be restocked).
- Customer churn analysis.

## üîÑ Migration & Integration Insights

### Complexity Assessment
- **Migration Complexity:** Medium complexity; the database is relatively well-structured but requires performance optimization and addressing the `film_text` table.
- **Effort Estimate:** 1-2 months for optimization and addressing immediate concerns; longer for a full migration to a different database system.

### Integration Recommendations
- No items identified
