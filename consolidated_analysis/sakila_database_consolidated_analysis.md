## üé™ Core Entities & Relationships

### Primary Entities
**Film** (film)
  - Purpose: Stores information about films available for rent.
  - Data Volume: Medium

**Customer** (customer)
  - Purpose: Stores information about customers who rent films.
  - Data Volume: Medium

**Staff** (staff)
  - Purpose: Stores information about store employees.
  - Data Volume: Very Low

**Inventory** (inventory)
  - Purpose: Tracks the availability of films in each store.
  - Data Volume: Medium-High


### Key Relationships
**Film ‚Üî Actor** (many-to-many)
  - Meaning: A film can have multiple actors, and an actor can be in multiple films.

**Film ‚Üî Category** (many-to-many)
  - Meaning: A film can belong to multiple categories, and a category can contain multiple films.

**Rental ‚Üî Customer** (many-to-one)
  - Meaning: A customer can have multiple rentals, but a rental belongs to only one customer.

**Rental ‚Üî Inventory** (many-to-one)
  - Meaning: A rental is for a specific inventory item.

**Inventory ‚Üî Film** (many-to-one)

## üìä Data Quality Assessment

### Integrity Analysis
- **Referential Integrity:** Mostly well-maintained with foreign key constraints.  `film_text` table is suspicious as it's empty.
- **Data Consistency:** High due to proper normalization and constraints.
- **Completeness Score:** 90/100

### Accuracy Indicators
- Proper data types
- Constraint enforcement (mostly)

---

## ‚ö° Performance Analysis

### Query Patterns
- Retrieving films by title, category, or actor.
- Finding customer rental history.
- Checking film availability in a specific store.
- Generating sales reports.
- Searching for customers by name or email.

### Identified Bottlenecks
- Potential for large table scans on `film`, `customer`, and `rental` tables without optimized indexing.
- Inefficient joins if indexes are missing on foreign keys.

### Optimization Opportunities
- Add composite indexes to improve join performance (e.g., `rental` table: `(rental_date, inventory_id, customer_id)`).
- Add indexes on frequently queried columns (e.g., `film.title`, `customer.last_name`, `customer.email`).
- Consider database partitioning or sharding if data volume grows significantly.
- Evaluate the need for full-text search and implement it efficiently if necessary (consider replacing `film_text`).
